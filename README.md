# Chrome-extension-FindAndReplace
It is chrome extension that can find and replace any word (or a string of words) on any website with whatever you want.   For ex - by default after adding the extension to your chrome, open the wiki page of Rahul Gandhi and you will find the string "Rahul Gandhi" replaced with "Apna PAPPU" all over the page, it works everywhere : like on google search results. ;)

Steps:

-Download the zip folder, unzip it.

-Go to chrome://extensions/ or simply extensions tab in the settings.

-Make sure the Developer mode checkbox is ticked in the middle-top of the screen.

-Click Load unpacked extension and select the folder.

-Go to the wikipedia page of Rahul Gandhi and see if its working :D!!


*To change the words or strings of your choice to another, make changes to the replace.js file accordingly, reload the chrome://extensions/ page and you are good to go.
